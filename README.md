### Project Description
Karinaku Counter is a fun web tool that counts visible melanoma ("karinaku") on a human tongue from a photo.  
Upload a close-up tongue image, and the app uses computer vision to detect and highlight each taste bud, displaying the

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Have you ever wondered exactly how many melonoma are visible on your tongue at any given moment? Neither have we! But for those burning with curiosity (or just bored), counting "karinaku" by hand is tedious, imprecise, and frankly, a little werid.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a web app that uses computer vision to automatically count and highlight each visible taste bud ("karinaku") on your tongue from a photo.  
Just upload a close-up tongue pic, and our algorithm does the rest‚Äîno manual counting, no mirrors, no awkward selfies. It's fast, fun, and completely unnecessary!
